# Default Channel Manager Configuration
# All 6 channels enabled with fiber optic as primary

channel_manager:
  # Enable all communication channels
  enabled_channels:
    - fiber
    - starlink
    - 4g
    - wifi
    - dmr
    - expresslrs

  # Priority chain (1 = highest priority)
  # Operator can modify this order based on mission requirements
  priority_chain:
    1: fiber        # Primary: Fiber optic (lowest latency, up to 3km)
    2: starlink     # Secondary: Starlink Mini (global coverage)
    3: 4g           # Tertiary: 4G/5G cellular (good coverage)
    4: wifi         # Quaternary: WiFi (short range, high bandwidth)
    5: dmr          # Quinary: DMR radio (voice control, emergency)
    6: expresslrs   # Last resort: ExpressLRS (always available, manual RC)
    7: safe_stop    # Final failsafe: Stop all motors

  # Timeout for each channel (seconds)
  # If no data received within timeout, channel considered failed
  timeouts:
    fiber: 2.0        # Fiber should have low latency
    starlink: 3.0     # Satellite may have higher latency
    4g: 3.0           # Cellular may have variable latency
    wifi: 2.0         # WiFi should be fast
    dmr: 5.0          # Voice commands may be slower
    expresslrs: 1.0   # RC link should be very fast

  # Hysteresis time (seconds)
  # Minimum time before switching back to higher priority channel
  # Prevents rapid channel switching (flapping)
  hysteresis_time: 5.0

  # Update rate for health monitoring (Hz)
  update_rate: 10.0
