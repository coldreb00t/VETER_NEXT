# Long Range Configuration
# Optimized for missions beyond line-of-sight
# Prioritizes satellite and cellular over local channels

channel_manager:
  # Long-range channels enabled
  enabled_channels:
    - starlink      # Satellite (global coverage)
    - 4g            # Cellular (wide coverage)
    - expresslrs    # RC backup (line-of-sight only)

  # Priority chain: Satellite → Cellular → RC backup
  priority_chain:
    1: starlink     # Primary: Starlink for global coverage
    2: 4g           # Secondary: 4G/5G cellular
    3: expresslrs   # Tertiary: RC manual override
    4: safe_stop    # Failsafe

  # Timeouts adjusted for long-range latency
  timeouts:
    starlink: 5.0     # Satellite has higher latency
    4g: 4.0           # Cellular may have variable latency
    expresslrs: 1.0   # RC should be fast when available

  # Longer hysteresis for satellite connections
  # Prevents switching away from satellite on brief hiccups
  hysteresis_time: 10.0
